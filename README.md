# 🧮 Math Rebuild

**Author:** Matt Estridge  
**Language:** C  
**IDE:** VS Code (MSYS2 + GCC)  
**Goal:** Rebuild my math foundation from the ground up — starting with 3rd-grade arithmetic and progressing through College Algebra — while reinforcing every concept through C programming.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project documents my journey to *relearn mathematics from scratch* and *strengthen my C programming logic* at the same time.  
Each folder represents a grade level or math topic from [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org), and every `.c` file is a small program that implements, explores, or visualizes that concept through code.

By the end of this project, I aim to:
- Close any remaining math knowledge gaps.  
- Make C second nature before moving into higher-level logic and algorithms.  
- Build a clean, educational GitHub portfolio that shows structured learning, discipline, and progression.
